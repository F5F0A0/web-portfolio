Plans for Web Portfolio

I plan to create a job-seeking web portfolio that will also serve as a personal hub documenting my education, projects, and interests. My site will primarily focus on my programming projects since I am majoring in Computer Science and Data Science. I want my site to be modular so I can update it during my junior and senior years at Pitt, and after graduation too. By including artistic and personal projects, such as my soundscape narrative and visual argument, I hope to provide a holistic view of who I am to potential employers. I aim to showcase my skills in design and coding through a well-built HTML/CSS website. By creating a clean, easily navigable layout and featuring my best projects, I hope to impress potential employers with my quality of work. I am eager to see my site on the web through GitHub hosting! I want my site to have a clean, simple grid layout, featuring a combination of text and images, and easily identifiable links and navigation, so visitors enjoy their time and see the cool stuff I have made.
